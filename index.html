        <p class="text-small">
          is one of the main protagonists of the Jujutsu Kaisen series. He is a
          special grade jujutsu sorcerer and widely recognized as the strongest in the world. Satoru is the pride of the
          Gojo Family, the first person to inherit both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in four hundred years. He works
          as a teacher at the Tokyo Jujutsu High and uses his influence to protect and train strong young allies.

        Satoru is a very tall man with a lean build in his later twenties who is considered relatively attractive,
        mainly due to his facial features. He has snow-white hair and the Six Eyes, which are a vibrant blue color.
        Satoru normally covers his eyes with a black blindfold which props up his hair and gives it a spikier
        appearance. When sporting a more casual look, Satoru will wear sunglasses and let his hair down to reach the
        base of his neck.
        <br />
        While working, Satoru wears a dark blue zip-up jacket with a high collar that's also fairly wide. He wears
        slim-fit matching black pants and black dress boots. Before switching over to a simple blindfold, Satoru used to
        wear bandages over his eyes. Satoru enjoys wearing expensive clothing[5] and has a number of casual looks he'll
        pair with wearing his sunglasses. As a Tokyo Jujutsu High student, Satoru wore the normal school uniform with
        his sunglasses before adopting any sort of makeshift blindfold.

    <div class="paras">
      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Personal character traits</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Satoru is a complex individual. He is normally seen to be nonchalant and playful towards his students, close
        colleagues, and friends. However, he is unsympathetic and cruel towards sorcerer executives, an example being
        his blatant disrespect towards Principal Gakuganji, and his enemies.
        <br />
        Satoru is extremely confident in his abilities and reputation as a powerful sorcerer, believing himself to be
        invincible. His opinion of others often only go as far as his judgement of their strength, and he is quite
        apathetic towards anyone he deems weak. Additionally, greatly influenced by his own desire for power, he is very
        arrogant. He is convinced that he is the strongest in the world, which he technically is, claiming, during his
        fight with Toji Fushiguro, that "throughout the Heavens and earth, he alone is the honored one." This can be
        further exemplified when he was tasked with protecting Riko Amanai, one of the few 'weak' people he genuinely
        grew to show compassion for. However, any empathy of her death was soon negated by his extensive amount of pride
        and arrogance after perfecting his reverse cursed technique in his following battle against Toji Fushiguro.

    <div class="paras">
      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Overall Skill Level</p>
      <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
        Even among the special grade sorcerers, Satoru is known to be the strongest sorcerer in the series, holding both
        immense amounts of cursed energy and a dangerously powerful technique. No one can seemingly match his skill
        level in the current storyline.
        <br/>
        As a student, Satoru and Suguru were both considered "the strongest", capable of making short work of
        experienced and powerful curse users. After realizing and perfecting his capabilities, Satoru's abilities vastly
        increased to where he was able to put Toji Fushiguro into the defensive and ultimately kill him with his
        strongest technique, whereas before he and Geto were no match for the renowned Sorcerer Killer. As he continued
        to grow, he eclipsed Suguru's might to where Suguru admitted Satoru has truly become the strongest alone. Suguru
        also stated that Satoru had the capability of killing all of humanity by himself, which Suguru admitted was out
        of his own ability, and didn't even try to fight back when Satoru prepared to kill him, although Satoru
        ultimately relented as he was unable to kill his former friend.
